# JavaScript

## What is JavaScript?

Javascript is a scripting language, also known as an interpreted language
interpreted languages are not compiled, they are interpreted
This means the program reads the language, that are then translated into instructions, which it then runs on the computer.
All modern browsers contain a JavaScript interpreter

C++ is a compiled language
Compiled languages aer written in code that gets compiled and turned into machine code
Machine code, is run directly on the computer.

Java and C# are both interpreted and compiled
They will both compile to what is called byte code
And that bite code will run on an interpreter also known as a runtime

C#, C++ and C are all different languages
C -> C++ -> C#

Java was really really popular
Lets rename our language to be called JavaScript
Every language has arrays, loops and conditional statements

High, medium and low level languages
low level -> C, C++, Rust
Mid Level -> C#, Java,
High Level -> JavaScript, Python

Visual Studio is an IDE
VS code is a text editor

.NET core
.NET Framework
ASP.NET
.Net

## Who decides what JavaScript should look like?

ECMA does. Each year they release the ECMAscript specification
And it is up to the companies that write the interpreters to match that specification

## Web console

We can run JS code directly into the console

## In an html file

We can write our JS into our html

## JS Files

We can write our JS in \*.js files and then run them in our html using `<script src="something.js">`
HINT: add the `defer` keyword to make your js file run at the end, rather than at the time it is read

## Other ways of running JS

NPM is short for Node package manager
NODE in NPM stand for node.js
All node packages are JS files
