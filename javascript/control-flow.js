// CHALLENGE

// Challenge: Odds & Evens
// MVP:
// Check if a number is odd or even
// Create variable n
// Write an if / else block
// If the number passed in is even return a string "n is even"
// If the number is odd return a string "n is odd"

// const findOddNumber = () => {
//     const n = 11;

//     if (n % 2 === 0) {
//         return "Number is EVEN";
//     } else {
//         return "Number is ODD";

// Challenge: Comparing Numbers
// MVP:
// Check for the smallest value
// Create two variables x & y
// Write an if / else block
// It should compare a number x to another number y
// It should print ("x is greater than y") in the console
// Or "x is smaller than y"
// Or "x is equal to y"
// Depending on the value of x and y
// BONUS: Find the largest value out of x, y and z

// MVP:

// Use the following image as a reference
// Bonus:
// Store the value of the childâ€™s eye colour and write a switch statement - depending on the childâ€™s eye colour consol log if it's your favourite eye colour, your least favourite eye colour or the mediocre colour
